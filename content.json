Some TipsWe explore unsupervised pre-training for speech recognition by learning representations of raw audio. wav2vec is trained on large amounts of unlabeled audio data and the resulting representations are then used to improve acoustic model training. We pre-train a simple multi-layer convolutional neural network optimized via a noise contrastive binary classification task. Our experiments on WSJ reduce WER of a strong character-based log-mel filterbank baseline by up to 36% when only a few hours of transcribed data is available. Our approach achieves 2.43% WER on the nov92 test set. This outperforms Deep Speech 2, the best reported character-based system in the literature while using two orders of magnitude less labeled training data Our model, wav2vec, is a convolutional neural network that takes raw audio as input and computes a general representation that can be input to a speech recognition system. The objective is a contrastive loss that requires distinguishing a true future audio sample from negatives. Different to previous work (van den Oord et al., 2018), we move beyond frame-wise phoneme classification and apply the learned representations to improve strong supervised ASR systems. wav2vec relies on a fully convolutional architecture which can be easily parallelized over time on modern hardware compared to recurrent models used in previous work. We introduce wav2vec, the first application of unsupervised pre-training to speech recognition with a fully convolutional model. Our approach achieves 2.43% WER on the test set of WSJ, a result that outperforms the next best known character-based speech recognition model in the literature (Amodei et al., 2016) while using two orders of magnitude less transcribed training data. improves resource-poor setups settings where all WSJ training data is used ObjectiveOur model takes raw audio signal as input and then applies two networks. encoder network : embeds the audio signal in a latent space context network : combines multiple time-steps of the encoder to obtain contextualized representations Given raw audio samples $x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$, we apply the encoder network $f : \\mathcal{X} → \\mathcal{Z}$ parameterized as a five-layer convolutional network Next, we apply the context network $g : \\mathcal{Z} → \\mathcal{C}$ to the output of the encoder network to mix multiple latent representations $z_i…z_{i-v}$ into a single contextualized tensor $c_{i}= g(z_{i}…z_{i−v})$ for a receptive field size $v$. The objective is a contrastive loss that requires distinguishing a true future audio sample from negatives. We train the model to distinguish a sample $z_{i+k}$ that is $k$ steps in the future from distractor samples $\\widetilde{z}$ drawn from a proposal distribution $p_n$, by minimizing the contrastive loss for each step $k = 1,…,K$: $$L_k = -\\sum_{i=1}^{T-k}(log\\sigma(z_{i+k}^{T}h_k(c_i))+\\lambda\\mathbb{E}[log\\sigma(-\\widetilde{z}^{T}h_k(c_i))])$$ $$\\mathcal{L} =\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\mathcal{L}_k$$ $\\sigma(x)=1/(1+exp(-x))$ : sigmoid $\\sigma(z_{i+k}^{T}h_{k}(c_i))$ : the probability of $z_{i+k}$ being the true sample We consider a step-specific affine transformation(仿射变换) $h_k(c_i) = W_{k}c_{i}+b_{k}$ for each step $k$, that is applied to $c_i$(van den Oord et al., 2018). We optimize the loss $\\mathcal{L} =\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\mathcal{L}_k$, summing (1) over different step sizes.

However, unlike humans who are capable of self-learning through experiences and interactions, current real-world speech applications are heavily reliant on large volumes of human annotations. For the next generation of speech processing systems to exhibit similar levels of cognitive intelligence as humans, they should be designed to exploit unlabeled, partially labeled, contextual and distant supervision data from multiple concurrent modalities, e.g., text and video, and learning signals from corrective user follow-ups in conversational applications. The main motivation for self-supervised learning is rooted in our need to improve ASR systems when there is a limited amount of labeled data. Self-supervised learning methods [LeCun 2016] construct proxy predictive tasks to train models for downstream scenarios by exploiting large amounts of unlabeled audio data, unpaired text and audio data in the same domain, or speech data with distant unrelated labels, e.g. A text summary or slides of an audio lecture. Through these invented proxy tasks, models learn high-level representations that generalize well across different languages, domains, and deployment scenarios with very few in-domain labeled examples. Self-supervised learning methods achieved major successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [Peters 2018, Devlin 2018, Radford 2019, Raffel 2019, Lewis 2019] and Computer Vision (CV) [Sun 2019, He 2019, Xie 2019, Misra 2019]. There is a recent surge in speech processing research work introducing predictive proxy tasks for model training, and achieving impressive results in downstream applications like ASR and speaker recognition. These self-supervised approaches include, but not limited to: Future prediction: Learning an autoregressive model that generates distant future audio features from historical ones [Oard 2018, Chung 2019, Schneider 2019]. Mask prediction: Learning a model that predicts masked parts of the input audio signal [Liu 2019, Song 2019, Baevski 2019a, Baevski 2019b]. Generating contextual data: Learning a model to predict semantically-related contextual information that accompany the speech signal, e.g. Using social media title and comments as input audio labels [Singh 2019, Pascual 2019]. Chaining ASR and TTS: Using unpaired audio and text data to train an ASR system and a TTS system jointly, where one is generating training paired data for the other [Tjandra 2019, Hori 2019, Baskar 2019]. This family of self-supervised methods can be viewed as auto-encoders of speech signals through latent text representations. Effective use of external language models falls into this category to regularize the text representations. Workshop - ICML 2019 Self-Supervised LearningBig data has driven a revolution to many domains of machine learning thanks to modern high-capacity models, but the standard approaches – supervised learning from labels, or reinforcement learning from a reward function – have become a bottleneck. Even when data is abundant, getting the labels or rewards that specify exactly what the model must do is often intractable. Collecting simple category labels for classification is prohibitive for millions of billions of examples, and structured outputs (scene interpretations, interactions, demonstrations) are far worse, especially when the data distribution is non-stationary. Self-supervised learning is a promising alternative where proxy tasks are developed that allow models and agents to learn without explicit supervision in a way that helps with downstream performance on tasks of interest. One of the major benefits of self-supervised learning is increasing data efficiency: achieving comparable or better performance with less labeled data or fewer environment steps (in Reinforcement learning / Robotics). The field of self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly evolving, and the performance of these methods is creeping closer to the fully supervised approaches. However, many of these methods are still developed in domain-specific sub-communities, such as Vision, RL and NLP, even though many similarities exist between them. While SSL is an emerging topic and there is great interest in these techniques, there are currently few workshops, tutorials or other scientific events dedicated to this topic. This workshop aims to bring together experts with different backgrounds and applications areas to share inter-domain ideas and increase cross-pollination, tackle current shortcomings and explore new directions. The focus will be on the machine learning point of view rather than the domain side. ICML 2020 Self-supervision in Audio and SpeechThe ongoing success of deep learning techniques depends on the quality of the representations automatically discovered from data. These representations must capture important underlying structures from the raw input, e.g., intermediate concepts, features, or latent variables that are useful for the downstream task. While supervised learning using large annotated corpora can leverage useful representations, collecting large amounts of annotated examples is costly, time-consuming, and not always feasible. This is particularly problematic for a large variety of applications. In the speech domain, for instance, there are many low-resource languages, where the progress is dramatically slower than in high-resource languages such as English.

It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting. RealNVPUnsupervised learning of probabilistic models is a central yet challenging problem in machine learning. Specifically, designing models with tractable learning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task. We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful, stably invertible, and learnable transformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exact log-likelihood computation, exact and efficient sampling, exact and efficient inference of latent variables, and an interpretable latent space. We demonstrate its ability to model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log-likelihood evaluation, and latent variable manipulations. “The advantage of Real NVP compared to MAF and IAF is that it can both generate data and estimate densities with one forward pass only, whereas MAF would need D passes to generate data and IAF would need D passes to estimate densities.” GlowFlow-based generative models (Dinh et al., 2014) are conceptually attractive due to tractability of the exact log-likelihood, tractability of exact latent-variable inference, and parallelizability of both training and synthesis. \b In this paper we propose Glow, a simple type of generative flow using an invertible $1 \\times 1$ convolution. Using our method we demonstrate a significant improvement in log-likelihood on standard benchmarks. Perhaps most strikingly, we demonstrate that a generative model optimized towards the plain log-likelihood objective is capable of efficient realisticlooking synthesis and manipulation of large images. Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and InferenceNormalizing flows provide a general mechanism for defining expressive probability distributions, only requiring the specification of a (usually simple) base distribution and a series of bijective(双射) transformations. There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning. 相关论文NICE: Non-linear Independent Components Estimation, Dinh et al. 2014 Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows, Rezende and Mohamed 2015 Density estimation using Real NVP, Dinh et al.

A subset of VT, Voice conversion (VC) specifically aims to change a source speaker’s speech in such a way that the generated output is perceived as a sentence uttered by a target speaker. Despite many years of research, VC systems still exhibit deficiencies in accurately mimicking a target speaker spectrally and prosodically, and simultaneously maintaining high speech quality.

probability of x given z 边缘概率贝叶斯估计和极大似然估计 MLE, Maxium Likelihood Estimator：极大似然估计 MAP, Maxium a Posterior：最大后验概率 最大似然估计和贝叶斯估计最大区别便在于估计的参数不同。 最大似然估计是一种确定模型参数值的方法。确定参数值的过程，是找到能最大化模型产生真实观察数据可能性的那一组参数。要估计的参数 $θ$ 被当作是固定形式的一个未知变量，然后我们结合真实数据通过最大化似然函数来求解这个固定形式的未知变量。 贝叶斯估计则是将参数视为是有某种已知先验分布的随机变量，意思便是这个参数他不是一个固定的未知数，而是符合一定先验分布如：随机变量θ符合正态分布等！那么在贝叶斯估计中除了类条件概率密度 $p(x|w)$ 符合一定的先验分布，参数 $θ$ 也符合一定的先验分布。我们通过贝叶斯规则将参数的先验分布转化成后验分布进行求解。 在贝叶斯模型使用过程中，贝叶斯估计用的是后验概率，而最大似然估计直接使用的是类条件概率密度。 最大似然估计（和其他类似方法）把待估计的参数看作是确定性的量，只是其取值未知。最佳估计就是使得产生已观测到的样本（即训练样本）的概率为最大的那个值。 与此不同的是，贝叶斯估计则把待估计的参数看成是符合某种先验分布的随机变量。对样本进行观测的过程，就是把先验概率密度转化为后验概率密度，这样就利用样本的信息修正了对参数的初始估计值。 参考[1] B站-「一个模型」教你搞定贝叶斯和全概率公式 [2] 知乎-从最大似然估计开始，你需要打下的机器学习基石 [3]

What is a good representation? high-performing on a diverse set of downstream tasks using simple models. useful in transfer learning with small amounts of data for a new task. [1] Introduction Recently, Self-Supervised Learning(SSL) shows a promising approach for data representation. Self-Supervised Learning is a version of unsupervised learning where data provides the supervision, and the goal of SSL is learning represent the world before learning tasks. For instance, BERT is a well-know NLP model developed by Google for pre-training language representations. It leverages an enormous amount of plain text data publicly available on the web and is trained in an unsupervised manner, and it can map a variable-length sentence or word to a fixed-length vector for many NLP downstream tasks. In speech processing filed, the extraction and selection of the best parametric representation of acoustic signals is an important task in the design of any speech recognition system or speaker recognition sysytem. However, the characteristics of the speakers in speech signal are poorly captured by the traditional acoustic features, such as the amplitudes of a wave signal, log Mel spectrograms, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCCs), or Filter banks(Fbanks). The goal of Self-Supervised speech representation is to leverages an enormous amount of unlabeled speech data publicly available on the web and is trained in an unsupervised manner and find a transformation from the surface features that makes high-level properties of speech more accessible to downstream tasks, such as speech recognition and speaker recognition. Therefore, inspired by the idea of Self-Supervised Learning, I did some experiments about Self-Supervised Speech Representation Feature for Speaker Recongnition task.

Backgroud在说话人识别任务中，第一步大多都是对语音进行声学特征提取，从语音信号中提取例如 mfcc, fbank 这样的声学特征。通过提取声学特征，一帧高维度的语音信号(waveform)可以号用一个12~40维向量简洁地表示出来；一整段语音信号，就被表示为这种向量的一个序列。例如，梅尔刻度 (Mel scale)是一种基于人耳对等距的音高(pitch)变化的感官判断而定的非线性频率刻度，它与频率关系如下: $$M(f) = 2595 \\cdot log_{10}(1+\\frac{f}{700})$$ MFCC 的性能表现可能会受到如下因素的影响: the number of filters the shape of filters the way that filters are spaced the way that the power spectrum is warped 这些传统的声学特征是根据人耳的感知机理，例如掩蔽效应，人为设计的特征提取方法。这类方法可能并不适用于计算机的模式识别，使用传统的声学特征用于说话人识别可能存在一定的不合理性。例如: 声学特征提取过程中可能会存在一定的信息损失，导致识别性能降低。 声学特征参数的选取往往依赖于人的经验。不同的参数设置，会导致不同的系统识别的性能。 提取特征的过程中可能没有考虑人说话的上下文 context 信息。 What is self-supervised learning?最近，self-supervised learning 逐渐成为科研工作者们的关注重点。self-supervised learning 是无监督学习里的一类方法，主要是希望能够学习到一种通用的特征表达用于下游任务 Yann LeCun in AAAI2020 in self-supervised learning, the systerm learns to predict part of its input from other parts of it input. Goal: Learning to represent the world before learning tasks. Predict any part of the input from any other part Predict the future from the recent past Predict the past from the present Predict the top from the bottom 什么是一个好的 Representation ? high-performing on a diverse set of downstream tasks using simple models useful in transfer learning with small amounts of data for a new task 自监督学习已经在 CV 和 NLP 领域取得了极大的成功，以大名鼎鼎的 BERT 模型为例，它利用大规模无标注语料训练、获得文本的包含丰富语义信息的 Representation，然后将文本的语义表示在特定 NLP 任务中作微调后应用于该任务上。 目前self-supervised learning的主要有如下方法： 在 speech 领域，也有很多大佬进行了一系列的探索。从 interspeech2020 和 ICML2020 两个学术会议中，我们可以看出未来应该会有更多的大佬加入 self supervised learning 在 speech 领域的研究。 Interspeech2020 Special Session: New Trends in self-supervised speech processing ICML2020: Self-supervision in Audio and Speech Contrastive Predictive CodingContrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) 是由 Google DeepMind 出品的非常有代表性的自监督学习方法，可以用于语音、图片、文本以及强化学习。CPC的主要思想就是基于 context 信息的未来数据预测，以及通过采样的方式进行训练。 CPC 的出发点是最大化context vector $c$ 和数据输入 $x$ 之间的互信息（Mutual Information），使得 $c$ 包含足够的原始数据信息，因而可以作为新的特征表示。互信息定义如下： $$MI(x;c) = \\sum_{x,c}p(x,c)log\\frac{p(x|c)}{p(x)}$$ “对比学习”中的“对比”是 positive 样本 和 negative 样本的对比。在学习到的“表示空间”内，增大某样本与其 positive 样本之间的相似度，减少与negative 样本的相似度。CPC 目标是学习一个 encoder $f$ $$\\textrm{score}(f(x),f(x^{+})) &gt;&gt; \\textrm{score}(f(x), f(x^{-}))$$ score 函数是相似度的度量，例如可以设置为 $\\textrm{score}(a, b) = a^Tb$。一般在一个训练批量的 $N$ 个样本中，使用 1 个 positive 样本和 $N-1$ 个 negative 样本。 如果大量无监督但数据采样训练，最大化互信息，我们可以得到数据新的表征。非常值得一提的是，论文中对不同说话人表征在 $t-SNE$ 可视化图中展现出了不错的区分性。 WAV2VEC依据 CPC 论文的思路，FaceBook FAIR 团队提出了 wav2vec 模型利用大量未标记的音频数据预训练的方法用于提高 ASR 系统的性能。预训练模型是在 Fairseq 工具包中的 PyTorch 中实现的。 模型由两个卷积神经网络组成: Encoder Network $x \\rightarrow z$ : embeds the audio signal in a latent space Context Network $z \\rightarrow c$ : combines multiple time-steps of the encoder to obtain contextualized representations 与 CPC 原论文里略有不同的是，在 Context Network 上，wav2vec 采用的是卷积神经网络，而 CPC 采用的 Autoregressive Model 自回归模型，因此在 infer 的速度上 wav2vec 会更快。 预训练结束后，将上下文网络 $c_i$ 生成的表示形式作为声学特征输入，而不是使用 log-mel 滤波器组特征。 Self-Supervised Feature for Speaker Recongnition我想使用 self supervised learning 的方法改进当前说话人识别系统。创新点在于利用了大量无说话人 label 的语音数据去提高当前说话人识别系统的性能 首先通过大量没有任何标注的语音数据，依据语音时序上的上下文 context 信息，使用神经网络去重新学一个更加合理 speech 的 representation。这类 self-supervised features 对语音信号前后关系有更好地建模。可以对于说话人长时性描述更强。之后我们通过预训练好的模型，对语音进行特征提取，新的声学特征将取代 mfcc 和 fbank 这类传统的声学特征，作为说话人模型对输入。我们利用这种新的特征，和传统 i-vector 和 x-vector 表征学习相互结合。 总结来说就是使用预训练模型提取语音声学特征取代 mfcc 和 fbank 从而提高当前说话人识别系统的性能。预期可能取得如下结果: 进一步提高当前的说话人识别系统的性能，成为新的STOA。 说话人训练数据在 low resources 的情况下取得更好的性能。例如 self supervised feature＋100个spk数据集训练出来的模型性能约等于甚至好于 mfcc＋500个spk数据集训练出的模型。 降低当前说话人识别模型的参数量，即 x-vector 模型的网络结构不需要很深很复杂也可以达到不错的说话人识别效果。 进一步提高当前 anti-spoofing 系统的性能。 My ExperimentToolkits我的实验主要使用了如下两个工具: fairseq: 它是一个由 facebook AI research 团队维护的 seq2seq 模型工具包，wav2vec 是 fairseq 内的一个子项目，其中同时开源了相关的一些预训练模型 Kaldi: 它是一个主要由 Danney Povey 等人主要维护的语音工具包，其中包含了经典的说话人识别模型 (i-vector, x-vector等) 的全部 pipline 代码 Dataset &amp;
